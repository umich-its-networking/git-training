Create a project in GitLab
  - Use the project creation form: [{{ site.gitlaburl }}projects/new]({{ site.gitlaburl }}projects/new).
  - Call the project `basics`
  - For this exercise, create it under your own username, not any group that you may have access to (not everyone will have access to groups).
  - Set the Visibility Level to "Public".
