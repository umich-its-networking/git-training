Make sure that your git configuration includes your name and email address. These are used in the metadata that's included with each commit.

*You're on your own...* You'll want to use the `git config --global` command, see [Add your Git username and set your email]({{ site.gitlaburl }}help/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.md#add-your-git-username-and-set-your-email) for details.

Note that these commands will modify the `.gitconfig` file in your home directory. Try opening that file to see the configuration you just added.
